# learning reflection
There are 3 points that I realized.
1. The evolution of tools is fast. Since courses provide Gradle 2.x for students to learn, but I noticed 8.x is released by this march. New tools always lead to higher productivity in the long run. As programmers, we must maintain a passion for learning.
2. Even a simple application has a large backend in the real world. Even if we just write a 'Hello, World' application, it runs on Android, which is based on Linux. There are too many details in the backend. We are standing upon the shoulders of giants today.
3. Keeping applications backward-compatible is very challenging. Android has just released its 13th version (API 33), but in this world, even 10% of devices are running on a version older than 10.
